I usually edit Python code that has a lot of whitespace indenting.
The backspace key works nicely, and I'm able to delete indents,
but I'm unable to do so with the <Del> key.
I've searched the web, searched the scripts and tips, asked on the vim mailing list,
asked on IRC and read a lot of documentation.
In the end, I found it easier to write a Python script that gave me the desired behaviour.
So, here it is. It works for me.
